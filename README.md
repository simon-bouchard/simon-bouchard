## 📂 Projects

- 📚 [**Book Recommendation System**](https://github.com/simon-bouchard/Book_Recommendation_UI_with_FastAPI)  
  Built a FastAPI-based backend combining collaborative filtering (using embeddings and metadata) with a KNN model on the embeddings. Designed to handle real user-book interactions and deliver personalized recommendations.

- 🌐 [**Missing Semester Solutions Website**](https://github.com/simon-bouchard/Missing-Semester-Solutions)  
  Created a PHP-based website hosted with Apache to share organized notes and solutions for *The Missing Semester* course. Deployed on Oracle Cloud with DNS and HTTPS configured.

- 🎮 [**Secure Real-Time Multiplayer Game**](https://github.com/simon-bouchard/freecodecamp-project-secure-real-time-multiplayer-game)  
  Developed a simple real-time multiplayer game using Node.js and WebSockets. Focused on live state synchronization, session management, and secure communication between players.
